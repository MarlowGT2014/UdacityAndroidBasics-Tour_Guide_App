# Tour Guide App
Project 6 of 10 in the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree

This project was to create a simple app to showcase places of interest at a given location. For my particular app, I created it for locations in and around the city of Atlanta, GA - home.  

A crucial item in this project was the usage of an ArrayAdapter to set the Places of Interest into a viewable like that can be scrolled through. Much of the lessons leading up to this project dealt with understanding the boiler plate code required and what's occurring in the Adapter.
